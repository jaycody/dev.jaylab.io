# The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)

## Opening narration, The Control Voice, 1960s
- There is nothing wrong with your television set. 
- Do not attempt to adjust the picture. 
- We are controlling transmission. 
- If we wish to make it louder, we will bring up the volume. 
- If we wish to make it softer, we will tune it to a whisper. 
- We will control the horizontal. 
- We will control the vertical. 
- We can roll the image, make it flutter. 
- We can change the focus to a soft blur or sharpen it to crystal clarity. 
- For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear. 
- We repeat: there is nothing wrong with your television set. 
- You are about to participate in a great adventure. 
- You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to â€” The Outer Limits.

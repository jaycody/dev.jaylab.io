			<ul>
				<li><strong>scope</strong> is the set variables, objects, and functions you have access to</li>
				<li>js has FUNCTION SCOPE: the scope changes inside functions</li>
				<li>vars declared inside a function have local scope and are created/destroyed when the function starts and ends</li>
				<li>vars declared outside a function become GLOBALS.  all scripts and functions can access it</li>
				<li><strong>AUTOMATIC GLOBALS:</strong></li>
				<li>   -  a variable becomes global, (regardless of where it's created) if the var is undeclared when a value is assigned to it</li>
				<li>	- example of local var created inside function foo:  <strong>var car = "datsun"</strong></li>
				<li>	- example of GLOBAL var created inside function foo:  <strong>car = "datsun"</strong></li>
				<li><strong>VARIABLE LIFETIMES</strong></li>
				<li>	- var lifetimes begin when vars are declared. locals are deleted when function is completed.  globals are deleted when the page is closed.</li>
				<li><strong>GLOBALS in HTML</strong></li>
				<li>	- in HTML, the global scope is the window object: all global variables belong to the window object</li>
				<li>globals and functions can overwrite window variables</li>
				<li>any function, including a window object, can overwirte global variables and functions</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>examples</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>AUTOMATIC GLOBALS</h4>
					<p>If you assign a val to a var that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL.</p>
					<p id="idForExample01"></p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>HTML GLOBALS</h4>
					<p>In HTML, all global variables become window variables. see example02 in console</p>
					<p id="idForExample02"></p>


				</li>

			</ol>

			<script>
				//example 1
				console.log("example 1");
				functionForExample01();
				console.log("called from outside the function, carDeclared = " + typeof(carDeclared));
				console.log("called from outside the function, carUndeclared = " + carUndeclared);
				console.log(functionForExample01);
				
				document.getElementById('idForExample01').innerHTML = "'carUndeclared' is assigned " + carUndeclared + " without a type declaration, and therefor becomes a GLOBAL automatically. (see console)";
				
				function functionForExample01(){
					//assigned without 'var' declaration, it automatically becomes GLOBAL
					carUndeclared = 'datsun';
					//assigned WITH a 'var' declaration, scope remains local
					var carDeclared = 'JEEP';
					console.log("called from INSIDE the function, carDeclared = " + carDeclared);
				}

				//example 2
				console.log("example 2");
				document.getElementById("idForExample02").innerHTML = "window.carUndeclared = " + window.carUndeclared;
				console.log("called from outside the function: window.carUndeclared = " + window.carUndeclared);
